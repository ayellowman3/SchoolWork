<h2>Professional &amp; Personal Details</h2>
<p>I am currently 22 years old and I have many hobbies which include, travelling, cooking, lifting weights, playing sports, video editing, gaming, etc. The hobby that defines who I am today would be sports. I have played many sports starting from a young age through college, such as tennis, football, basketball, swimming, running, and golf. The lessons and skills from playing sports can be transitioned off the field into every aspect of my life. Learning how to play a sport is the same as doing anything else in life. Some things are easier to learn than others and some take more time and practice but in the end, it's all about reaching your goals to be successful. I felt the same way about programming because when I first started to learn programming, I had a difficult time understanding what coding is, but I kept pursuing it and I now enjoy programming. After college, I hope to find a career in programming, mobile development, or an information technology consultant.</p>
